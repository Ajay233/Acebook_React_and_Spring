## Planning

To plan this project I have completed the following:
- Database table planning using an Entity Relationship Diagram
- Process mapping using a domain model diagram
- Page layouts

### Entity Relationship Diagram

I have set out above the tables that will be contained within the database.  The entity relationship
diagram shows the links between tables i.e. where tables contain foreign keys from other tables.  The
diagram also outlines whether the relationships are one to many, many to many, one to one etc.

### Page layout planning for MVP

For my minimum viable product I planned to implement a login page, a page for signing up if a user
didn't have an account.  Upon login the user would be taken to the main page, where all posts would 
be rendered.  Each post should have the functionality to be updated and deleted.  Each post would also 
contain buttons to allow users to like the post and comment on it.  The page should also include a button 
to allow users to create posts.
